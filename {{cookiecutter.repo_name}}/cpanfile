## Additional Perl dependencies for the {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} application.
##
## Dependencies for this project are specified in two places, this file and the
## META files generated by Build.PL. Use this file to specify dependencies that
## cannot be listed in Build.PL, e.g. Git repos and develop phase dependencies.
## To avoid redundant information, do not list dependencies in both places.
##
## Some dependencies must be specified in META in order for cpanm installs to
## work as expected. Configure phase dependencies seem to be ignored by cpanm
## unless they are in META. Also, when this project is installed as a
## dependency of an upstream project, cpanm will only only attempt to install
## this project's depedencies if they are in META.*. If this project uses Git
## repo dependencies, they must either be installed manually or listed in the 
## cpanfile of the upstream project. Configure phase Git repo dependencies are
## a special case and *must* be installed manually before attempting to install 
## this project directly or as a dependency of another project.
